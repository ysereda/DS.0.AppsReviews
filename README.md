Data Science Prep course, The Apps Project

The Business Problem
  You’re working for a marketing consultancy firm (congrats on the new job!) One of your
clients is a company that designs operating systems, and they want to build a major
apps store into their user interface. To this end, they want to know whether Google Play
apps have higher reviews on average than Apple Store apps (or vice versa) , as they’re
intending to strike a deal with just one of these companies.
  This project includes a series of steps known as the Data Science Pipeline, or DSP.
The DSP is a general and fairly broad sequence of steps data scientists use to tackle
and solve business problems. Steps are:
1. Sourcing and loading data
2. Cleaning and transforming data
3. Visualizing and modeling data
4. Evaluating, presenting findings, and concluding your work
